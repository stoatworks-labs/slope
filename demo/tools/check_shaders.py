"""The demo's shaders must be the plugin's shaders, character for character.

    python3 demo/tools/check_shaders.py

Called from `tools/verify.sh`. Exit code 1 means the two copies have drifted.
Clamp's check, in this repo's shape.

------------------------------------------------------------------- why

`demo/plugin.js` holds four GLSL fragments and so does `source/Shaders.cpp`.
That is two copies of the same text, and two copies drift -- quietly, because a
demo that renders a *plausible* picture looks exactly like a demo that renders
the right one. The whole claim of these pages is that they run the plugin's own
shader rather than something reimplemented to look similar, so the claim needs
something enforcing it. For this plugin the claim is the whole page: the coder
IS the shader, and there is no CPU half to hide a difference in.

Nothing else can. `sltest` drives the real plugin class through a real FFGL
sequence and has no idea this page exists, and `tools/check-shaders.sh`
compiles the C++ copies and never looks at the JS one.

------------------------------------------------------------------- what it does

Pulls each `R"( ... )"` body out of the C++ and each matching backtick literal
out of `plugin.js`, and compares them exactly -- no whitespace normalisation, no
comment stripping. A comment that has been updated on one side and not the other
is exactly the drift worth catching, because comments in this repo carry the
reasoning that justifies the code.

The one transformation is a decode, not a normalisation. A backtick cannot
appear raw inside a JavaScript template literal, so `plugin.js` would have to
escape one as \\`; none of these shaders quotes one today, but a comment could
start to. This unescapes that and *rejects any other backslash on the JS side*;
there are none anywhere in the C++, so a second escape could only be somebody
hiding a difference. A `${` would be interpolated by the literal, so it is
refused on the C++ side before it can become a silent difference.

------------------------------------------------------------------- what it cannot

Nothing here checks the *ported* half. The control laws (`Controls.cpp`), the
draw schedule and the chunked viewport (`Slope::ProcessOpenGL`) and the
two-attachment state buffer (`StateBuffer.cpp`) are a hand translation in
plugin.js, and only a reader can tell whether they still agree. When you change
one of those, change it here too -- and remember that a wrong mapping shows up
on the page as a picture that is subtly wrong, which nobody will notice.
