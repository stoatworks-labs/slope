#
# Each check answers a question none of the others can:
#
#   build         a FRESH universal Release build. Not the dev build: CMake
#                 latches the architecture list at the first target, so the
#                 only build worth measuring is one configured from nothing.
#   shaders       does every shader compile, through a real GLSL compiler
#                 (tools/check-shaders.sh, which CI runs too), on the exact
#                 strings `sltest --dump-shaders` writes.
#   offline       the checks that need no GL:
#                   --laws      every control law against its statement, and
#                               the dyadic promises the exact checks rest on
#                   --names     nothing a host will silently truncate; the
#                               host reads SW Slope / SL01 / effect
#   physics       every rendering check, at TWO rasters: 320x180, which is
#                 what CI renders at, and 1280x720. Each is measured out of
#                 the picture:
#                   --overload  a step of height h climbs in ceil( h / step )
#                               samples, at whole- and part-sample edges
#                   --granular  a flat field's idle pattern: period 2, a
#                               peak-to-peak of one step
#                   --adapt     the step grows by the stated law per run; the
#                               climb shortens by the predicted count
#                   --tradeoff  over Adaptation Rate the climb shortens and
#                               the post-edge hunt's energy rises
#                   --leak      a forced bit error fades on the integrator's
#                               time constant
#                   --reference every pixel against a serial double run
#                   --vertical  a vertical scan is the transposed horizontal
#                               one, exactly
#                   --errors    bits flipped at the stated rate, freshly each
#                               frame
#                   --negative  every one of those FAILS on a perturbed coder
#   pipe          the fleet's --pipe contract: whole frames only, a cue naming
#                 no control refused, and exit 1 -- not a silent 0, not a
#                 SIGPIPE 141 -- on a failed render or a closed stdout, the
#                 last proved with `| head -c 1`.
#   sweep         does every control change the picture.
#   bench         the render cost, for the record. Not pass/fail.
#   registration  does the bundle contain a plugin at all -- a file-scope
#                 CFFGLPluginInfo nothing names, which a linker may drop while
#                 still producing a bundle that loads and exports plugMain.
#   lipo          is the build really universal.
#   plist         does CFBundleExecutable name the binary that is on disk.
#   codesign      the exact command the release job runs, against a copy.
#   oxbow         a real FFGL host loads the bundle and reports the name, id
#                 and type it sees -- the name field is not null-terminated
#                 and a host truncates silently past 16 characters.
