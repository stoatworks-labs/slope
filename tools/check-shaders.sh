# Every shader the plugin compiles, through a real GLSL compiler, before a host
# has to find out. Called by tools/verify.sh AND by CI, so the two cannot
# drift: a GitHub macOS runner cannot create an accelerated GL context, so in
# CI this is the only thing that looks at the GLSL at all. It is not a
# substitute for a driver -- only a real driver catches the class of bug where
# Apple's Metal-backed GL disagrees with the compiler, and that is checked on
# the dev Mac by the rendering checks, and nowhere else.

# The text compiled is what `sltest --dump-shaders` writes: the exact strings
# the plugin hands the driver, not a transcription of them.
#
# --target-env=opengl4.5 with -fauto-map-locations: glslc targets SPIR-V, which
# demands an explicit layout( location ) on every uniform and varying. Those
# are Vulkan rules and not GLSL ones, and without the flag every shader "fails"
# for reasons that have nothing to do with the code.
#
# glslc is optional -- `brew install shaderc` -- so a machine without it skips
# rather than fails.
